# CPSC_473_Project

CPSC 473 - Web Front-End Engineering for Internet Applications

Project 1 - Spring 2017

Use client-side JavaScript, AJAX, and Horizon  to build one of the applications listed below.  You may use any available third-party Web Service APIs, libraries, or modules, provided that you comply with the terms of their licenses.
Projects

Build a site where...
- Parents can share embarrassing baby pictures with their children’s potential dates
- Neighbors can shame other neighbors for their pets’ and / or children’s bad behavior
- Workers can anonymously snark about their bosses
- Local bands can solicit feedback on recent shows
- Politicians can exchange tips about avoiding their constituents
- Fans can share stories of encounters with their favorite celebrities.
- Students can vote on how likely it is that a given topic will show up on the next test
- Visitors can create their own “which character are you?” quizzes
- Contactees can alert each other of their most recent UFO sightings

Functionality
	Note that project descriptions are very brief and deliberately underspecified.  This is your chance for creativity. Begin with a set of possible features, plan according to the available time, and build something interesting. Think of the project not as a finished application, but as a proof-of-concept, prototype, or Minimum Viable Product.

Working with other teams
	You may discuss your project and the technologies you are using with other teams, but each team must build its own application and submit its own work.

Working with members of your team
	In general, each student in a group will receive the same grade.  If you run into issues with your teammates, it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve them.

	If you are unable to work with a member of your team (for example, if they disappear and fail to respond to attempts to contact them), bring the problem to my attention as soon as possible -- do not wait until the due date.

Presentations
	On presentation day, give a short demonstration of your application to the class.  Include both functionality and implementation details.  Your entire team must be present and available to answer questions, but you may designate individual team members to deliver the presentation.

Grading
	Each of the following factors contributes up to 3 points to the final grade for the project:
- Quality of the presentation
- Completeness of the presentation
- Quality of documentation for installation and configuration
- Quality of documentation for users
- Project functionality
- Project scope
- Code quality
- Code maintainability
- Appropriate use of available technologies
- Innovation
- Web design
- Teamwork
